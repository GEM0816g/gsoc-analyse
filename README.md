## About GSoC
Google Summer of Code is a global, online mentoring program focused on introducing new contributors to open source software development. GSoC contributors work on a 12 week programming project under the guidance of mentors from their open source organization.

Since 2005, the Google Summer of Code program has brought together 18,000+ new open source contributors and 17,000+ mentors from over 118 countries worldwide. Google Summer of Code has produced over 40 million lines of code for 746 open source organizations.

## About GSoC Analyse

In the GSoC group, I see a lot of people with this problem:

> I'm skilled in XXX and XXX. Which of the organizations are beginner- friendly in GSOC?
> Can you give me organisation names that deal with XX XX XX and XX as I am skilled in this skills?
>
> To enable more people to use their skills to find Gsoc open source organizations that are right for them, I analyzed participating organizations in 2021. I hope this statistic helps them.

Using data from the official website, I analyzed all the organizations participating in 2021.

According to the classification of Technologies mentioned by the organization, I sorted out the following results.
